INSTALL

TP-MAP is implemented in Java 11 and compilation is automated using Apache Maven. Installation time on a typical computer should be under 5 minutes.

DEPENDENCIES

Please ensure up-to-date versions of Java JDK11 and Apache Maven are installed on your system.

Download these via your system package manager or via the links below:

Java JDK11

Apache Maven

  http://maven.apache.org/

Additional dependencies will be downloaded automatically through Apache Maven during the build process.


BUILD

To compile the software on your system, ensure that JAVA_HOME is set to your JDK. 

e.g. on macOS

  $ export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home

The software can be compiled using the command:

  $ mvn clean package

This will create a jar file in the target/ directory.
